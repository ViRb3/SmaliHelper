# Smali Helper v2
A simple offline documentation browser for Smali - the human-readable representation of Android's Dalvik bytecode.

**Note:** the documentation used in this app (everything under the *'HelpFiles'* directory) belongs to *Virtuos Ten Studio* and the team behind it. I take absolutely no credit for their content.
